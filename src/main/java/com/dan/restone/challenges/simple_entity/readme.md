### Entity Class Mapping
- Create a simple Java entity class representing a domain object, such as "Student" or "Product". 
- They should use Hibernate annotations to map the entity class to a corresponding database table.
- Write a simple Java program using Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the entity class, and test the program by inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in the database.


### Query Methods
- Create a Java repository interface using Spring Data JPA that extends the JpaRepository interface. 
- They should define query methods in the repository interface to retrieve data from the database based on different criteria, such as: 
  - finding all records with a specific attribute value 
  - retrieving records sorted by a certain field
  - finding records that match a certain pattern
- Test the program by executing different queries and verifying the results.
